Becoming a Dramatically Better Programmer: Henry Stanley.

What does getting dramatically better look like?
-Learning Skills Directly
	Ex: Why would you learn Haskell and Go if you don't use them in your daily work?
	Ans: Knowledge Compunds, while Haskell and Go may not directly impact your work you can learn to be a better programmer by understanding them. Knowledge does not exist in a vaccum.
