The Difference between Pros and Amateurs:

	-Pros are not simply better than amateurs, they win completely differently.
		-When pros compete they win by a slight edge over the other player, but both have the fundamental strengths down pat.

		-When amatuers compete it comes down to who makes the fewest large mistakes.

	-Coaches drill these mistakes out of you and bring your level up.

	-When amatuers bluder:
		-Things they don't think are a big deal.
		-Things they don't even see.

	-Sit down with a pen and paper and figure out what pros do that you don't.

	-What are your amatuer mistakes?

		*I don't think anyone truley successful is trying to do so many things at once.
		*Pros do not get as distracted.
		*Pros do not get as angry.
		*Pros do more deep work without distraction.
		*I have distraction built into my life, why do I do this?
		*I try to get the most out of life, but that makes me miss the great things.
		*Fear of what will come, the answer is always fear.
